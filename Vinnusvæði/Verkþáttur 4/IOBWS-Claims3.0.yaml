  version: "3.0"
  description: |
    The service is two folded.
    1. Claims methods used by companies
    2. Collection used by collection companies

    Claim Service
    The Claims Service enables creditors to create, modify and cancel claims. A creditor can also revive canceled
    claims, send claims to an intermediate debt collector and obtain a list of claims according to the given search
    criteria, and thus get a good overview of all their claims.

    Collection Service
    The Collection Service enables dept collectors to work with the claims under their care. The service is mostly
    as structured as the service for claims, except that it is not possible to create collection claims
