<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Icelandic banks together with RB (Reiknistofa bankanna), SÍ (Central Bank of Iceland), various software companies, billing companies, Fintech companies and other stakeholders associated with the technical committee "Tækninefnd um fjármálaþjónustu" (TN FMÞ) at the Icelandic Standards Council have issued several version of technical standard documents, that describe  how Icelandic banks offer public application programming interfaces for digital transactions and data queries in the context of financial services.
The first version of those standards was published in 2007 and was named IOBWS (Icelandic Online Banking Web Service).
Six years later, version 2, IOBWS 2.0 of the standard was published. Some of that previous work was facilitated using public code repositories but those were not part of the final delivery.
When it came time to upgrade the standard to version 3.0 of IOBWS, the participants agreed to use the a code repository as central hub for the work, with the aim of using it on a continuing to handle bug fixes as well as upgrades to the protocols, security standards and business operations that might result from feedback after the first iteration.
